# **Campus Second-Hand Marketplace \- Technology Stack Standard (v2.0)**

Version 2.0 | Status: Official Release | Revised by: Gem (AI Assistant) | Date: 2025-07-16  
Major Update: Migrated the frontend technology stack from JSP/jQuery to React \+ TypeScript. The system architecture has been adjusted to a decoupled frontend-backend model.

### **1\. Introduction**

#### **1.1. Purpose**

This document aims to clearly define the technical architecture, development languages, core frameworks, key libraries, and related tools used throughout the lifecycle of the "Campus Second-Hand Marketplace" project. Its purpose is to unify the team's technology choices, standardize the development environment, reduce communication costs, and provide a consistent technical baseline for all subsequent development, testing, deployment, and maintenance work.

#### **1.2. Scope**

This technology stack applies to all aspects of the project, including the backend service, frontend application, database design, project build, and deployment. All team members must strictly adhere to the technical standards specified in this document.

### **2\. Technical Architecture**

This project will adopt a modern **Frontend/Backend Separation** web application architecture.

* **Backend**: A stateless, **pure RESTful API service**. It is responsible for handling all business logic, data persistence, and security validation, providing services externally through a unified JSON format API. The backend itself is not responsible for rendering any pages.  
* **Frontend**: An independent **Single Page Application (SPA)**. It fetches and submits data by calling the RESTful APIs provided by the backend and is responsible for rendering all user interfaces and handling user interactions.

This architectural pattern allows for parallel development of the frontend and backend, improving development efficiency and enabling the technology stacks of both ends to evolve independently.
